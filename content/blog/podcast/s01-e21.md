## Show Notes

SwiftUI has a great way to handle data in your applications once you understand it. This week as I work on the next part of my SwiftUI application series on Patreon I had to dive in and discover @State @ObservableObject and @EnvironmentObject to be able to use my data across the application and have SwiftUI take care of all the UI updates for me as the data changed.

Once you understand how it works using just a few lines of code to set everything up, it will handle a lot of the data management for you in the background.

In this episode, I'll explain how I set it up and what I learned along the way.
