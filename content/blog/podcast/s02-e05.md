- New Apple Silicon Macs - Mac Mini - MacBook Air - MacBook Pro 13‚Äù
- Big Sur Released
- Results of two poles suggest a lot of you are waiting to upgrade to Big Sur
- Xcode 12.2 Released which includes - Swift 5.3 - Support for debugging both Intel and Apple Silicon builds - Support for debugging iPhone and iPad apps running on supported Mac hardware
- [App Store Small Business Program](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/) - 15% instead of 30% goes to Apple - You have to apply to be part of it and the requirement is to earn less than $1 million per year.
	- If you go above $1 million then it reverts back to 30% for the rest of the year.
- In a recent poll I ran on Twitter asking if you watch or are interested in live streaming it seems you are in favor of the idea if you can ask questions in real-time.
- Which iPhone did I get?
