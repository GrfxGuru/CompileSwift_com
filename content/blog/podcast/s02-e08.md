## Mentioned in this episode
[BitRise build automation service](https://app.bitrise.io/referral/42e309bfcb1d8655)

### Skills
- Swift and SwiftUI are a given, we all get those skills for free as we work with Apple platforms.
- What’s your niche or main focus going to be? AR, VR, Audio, Maps, video, Games?
- Are you going to review your toolset and drop the ones you never use or continue to keep them around?
- What about learning resources? Are there courses or books you paid for but never got around to working with?
- What subscriptions do you have that maybe you no longer need because you never use them or they never get updated? Are you still getting value from them?

### Code
- Did you use repetitive code last year in projects that you could turn into a framework or library?
- Did you do any or enough testing last year, is that something you can improve on this year?
- Have you updated your code bases to the latest versions of Swift or any other language you use? Did you deal with deprecations and API changes?
- Are you branches in source control nice and clean with old ones merged and removed?
- How about automating those builds so you never fall behind or have to remember to take care of them? I can recommend BitRise for simplifying the process and taking the pain out of it.
- How well did you document last year? is that something you can do better this year, maybe you didn’t do it at all?
