In a recent live stream on Twitch ([Twitch.tv/compileswift](https://twitch.tv/compileswift)) I was asked in the chatroom to give my thoughts on coding boot camps.

I answered the question, but I felt I should dive into the answer further in this episode and give more details. Youâ€™ll have to listen to hear my thoughts.
