Catching up after the Thanksgiving break in this episode.

A heads up that I will be appearing as a guest on the EmpowerApps podcast to discuss the year with Leo. Always a honor to be invited and a great conversation, I’m looking forward to that.

I also discuss my thoughts and findings after spending a couple of weeks with the new MacBook Pro 14” MAX. I go into the highs and lows experienced as I use it on a daily basis, I’m not going to ruin it by putting my results here, you will have to listen.
