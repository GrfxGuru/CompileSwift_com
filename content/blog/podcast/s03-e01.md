A very special episode with my friend Leo Dion from the EmpowerApps podcast joins me to talk about Appleâ€™s WWDC21 Keynote.

You will want to listen to the [EmpowerApps State of the Union episode](https://share.transistor.fm/s/ace13930) where I join Leo to discuss the deeper dive into the developer details.
