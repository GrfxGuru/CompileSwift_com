## Season 3 Episode 20

Just in time for this episode, Apple has kindly released new versions of their OS' and Xcode for us to talk about.

I also talk about my recent live stream on CompileSwift.live where I discover Figma and how it can help design and prototype a new iOS application I am working on.
