How's everybody doing welcome to another episode. It's been a little while I've been very busy with a lot of things and the world is even crazier than it was so apologies for the delay in getting an episode out.

But here we are, and this one is about something that's always been bothering me. You see lots of posts like the top five tips for being the best Uber developer in the world, and  10 ways to make your environment super fast.  Three ways that I've improved my production flow and all of these kinds of things.

And let's be honest. A lot of the time, those things are all the same in there. Some of them are just clickbait, no offense to anybody that does those. But what you don't see very often is tips on how to take care of yourself as a developer and approach it from that aspect.

Forget the tooling, forget the frameworks, forget the projects, forget all of that stuff. What about you, you as a developer? So that's what we're going to cover in this episode. I reached out to you all on Twitter and got some replies. Thank you to you all. We'll go through them here.
