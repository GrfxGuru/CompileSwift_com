From my first click wheel to the newer iPod touches, I still love my iPodâ€™s. In this episode, I share some fond memories of how it changed the way I consume media and how it changed an industry.

Yes, it was not the first mp3 player, but it is the one that got us to where we are today.

Also in this episode, new OS versions along with a shinny new Xcode 13.4.
