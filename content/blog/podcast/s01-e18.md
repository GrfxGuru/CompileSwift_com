## Show Notes

This week I have been adding menu bar view switching in my macOS application, and this gave me a problem to solve.

Just how do I change the state of a menu item programmatically using Swift. It took me a while to find a way that worked nicely.

In this episode I go over my solution and also some thoughts on forgetting to test your application properly before releasing to the World.

Here is a link to the article I mention

Plus, developers test those apps before you ship them, do not make assumptions.
