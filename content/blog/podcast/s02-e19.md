Yep that’s right! Not content with just a podcast, YouTube and posts. I decided to experiment with live stream coding on Twitch.tv.

Just [click this link](https://twitch.tv/compileswift) and remember to follow the channel to get easy access and know when it’s all going down.

I’d love for you to drop by and say hi or ask a question, you can even laugh at my code as it fails to compile, it’s all part of the fun that is the Swift community.
