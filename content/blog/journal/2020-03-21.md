As I continue to work on my application I created for personal use, I have a bug that I need to resolve. The frontmatter (metadata for a GatsbyJS post) is wrong for CompileSwift.com. I need to change the key name for the post description.

In this video that's exactly what I'm going to do and retain the working key for my other site PeterWitham.com

By the end of this video not only can you laugh at my code as I have not refactored it yet into something more modern, but we will have fixed the bug.
