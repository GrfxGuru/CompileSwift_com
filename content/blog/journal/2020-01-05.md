[Take me to the video](https://www.patreon.com/posts/04-refactoring-32903004)

Video 4 picks up right where video 3 left off. We noticed at the end of video 3 that we are going to have some problems with the materview layout we created using SwiftUI.

The title of the note is causing some layout problems with the rest of the information for each note.

By the end of the video we will go from what you see on the left to the right.
