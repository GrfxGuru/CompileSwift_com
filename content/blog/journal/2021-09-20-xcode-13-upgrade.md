description: Having checked my apps against Xcode 13, I passed the test

As of this post, Xcode 13 final release is now available. So I went over and downloaded and installed. I have had a pretty good experience this time around since WWDC21 in June with the early Xcode releases.

After working through some of my personal projects (there was also a live stream of this, [https://twitch.tv/compileswift](https://twitch.tv/compileswift)). I am happy that my projects passed the Xcode 13 and Swift 5.5 update without issue.

Or at least issues related to the new versions, the bugs I already had were there in the previous and Iâ€™m responsible for those!

So far I have only updated my iPad to the final version 15, I like to leave it a day before pushing the iPhone and Watch to the new updates, just incase anything starts appearing in reports across the interwebs.

I guess now is as good a time as any to start looking at the new things and getting used to them. Playing with something in beta, and then having to use it in the real-world are two very different things in my opinion.
