This week I focused on solving some of the layout problems with the master view we created in video 3. I also started building the form view for adding a note. Along the way, there was some refactoring and discovery of a better way to layout the master view row.

I also introduce you to adding buttons to a navigation bar, which is something users will be expecting and allows us to save space on the screens.

The video will be completed very soon after post production clean up. But here's a screenshot of what you should end up with by the end of video 4.
