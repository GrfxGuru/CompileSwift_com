I cannot thank everyone enough for dropping by and hanging out in the chatroom with the return to the live stream. It’s been a while for a few reasons, it is the crazy season after all for Apple platform developers.

We kicked it off by building a chat-like UI using SwiftUI and had great fun with chat at the same time.

Now it’s time to start preparing for WWDC22. We will have to much to look at and talk about for sure.
