description: This weekend I decided to explore some options to remove the burden of mundane coding.

It happens to all of us, we spend a lot of time maintaining things that we really should not have too. For example,

- Application version and build numbers
- Generating project metadata and files that rarely change
- Documenting code
- Managing project source code

So this weekend I’ve set out on a challenge to find and tackle at least some of these problems, you can expect me to share the results very soon.

Right now, I have at one solved that drives me crazy all the time, but I’m not saying which just yet!
