Continuing my series on rebuilding my open source [Code notes application](https://github.com/GrfxGuru/CodeNotesForiOS) using SwiftUI, video 5 is all about starting a new view to add a note to the application.

This means it is time to talk about input using a _form_ and also a brief introduction to the concept of _state_ to hold the data as we enter and display it.

This is a Patreon supported series, as of video 5 that means 1hr 39 minutes of video with plenty more to come.

I appreciate your support in funding this on-going premium content, thank you.
