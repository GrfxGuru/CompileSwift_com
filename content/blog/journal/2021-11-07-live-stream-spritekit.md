Some times it is all about doing things for the fun of it. This weekends live stream was just that, I have never worked with SpriteKit and I thought it was time to crack it open and have a little game creation fun.

It turned out to be easier to get started than I thought, by the end of this stream I have a simple touch responsive player ready for some animation in the next stream.
