description: In this live stream recording I started working with Swift scripting on the Mac terminal.

This weekend I spent some time learning to write scripts with Swift. So this was a prime topic for streaming it as I did so.

What I want is a script that I can run to automatically create my standard project structure any time I create a new project in Xcode. The reason for this is I simply do not like having everything in one folder/group in Xcode, which is what you get from the standard starting templates.

So I decided to move to the terminal and start making a script, in this session I learned how to create folders and move files.

Next Friday on the stream I plan to continue this exploration and further develop the script.

Swift really is a create way to write scripts it turns out.
