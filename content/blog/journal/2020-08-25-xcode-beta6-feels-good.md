description: As we get late into the beta releases, Xcode is feeling pretty solid to me.

Beta 6 of Xcode was released this week and for me, it is feeling very solid. So far I have not had any crashes or obviously noticeable bugs. I will stress that I have not tested every feature, so I am not claiming there are none.

I have been building my personal apps in the last couple of beta’s. In particular, my GatsbyJS blog writing application that I use for my sites.

I have also started building test versions to explore ideas for the next version that I plan to build with SwiftUI and a dynamic configuration system.

The wonderful thing about projects is that you get to explore any and every idea with many solutions, something that does not often occur when building applications for other people.

I am going to be very interested to see how I can weave the ideas of MVVM (Model-View View-Model) and SwiftUI together along with using Combine in an application. Since this is a personal project I also have time on my side to see what other members of the Swift community come up with to solve their problems.

Big Sur is also having far fewer issues with 3rd party applications that I use on a regular basis. This is pretty surprising to me as previous releases like Catalina caused too many issues from day one that prevented me from upgrading.

This might be the first time I embrace an initial macOS release when it comes out.

Until the final releases drop, I will continue to use the beta’s as much as I can to be sure everything is ready for me to use and trust on a daily basis.
