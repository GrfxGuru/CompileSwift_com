description: This week I managed to spend a little time on my macOS app, MetaMaker.

As this was my last week at the day job for the remainder of the year, it was crazy busy, as you can well imagine.

However, I did find time to work a little on my macOS app, MetaMaker.

I rearranged the UI a little to make space for a content field, I decided why not go ahead and make it a full post writing tool, albeit a basic one right now.

I also added an NSTextView so I have a multiline text editable field. This naturally mean't that I had to update the one on the preview screen as well so it can scroll to not only read the contents but to make it easily selectable.
