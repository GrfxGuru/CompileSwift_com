description: Yep time to install the beta but safely.

Warning: unless you are a developer do not install beta software this early in the game. Just saying, you won’t have a happy experience most likely.

So it’s time for me to try the new coolness of SwiftUI, which means I need the new Xcode beta and Big Sur.

It’s the only way you know, sure you can install Xcode 12 beta on macOS Catalina, but you will not be able to use some of the new things in either Xcode or SwiftUI.

So, it’s time to break out Parallels to keep my production machine safe and everything else nicely tucked away in a place I can delete and start over if needed.

Wish me luck, this is the only way I’ll be able to show you the new coolness with confidence.
