description: iOS and iPadOS 13 are big steps forward, and that means work for all of us on existing applications.

With the now released iOS 13.0 and the pending release on Tuesday Sept. 24th 2019 of iPadOS 13.1 and iOS 13.1, Apple has made some big moves forward in not only how the operating systems work but more importantly for users, how they look.

_**Dark mode**_ is now officially supported on Apple _i_ devices at the system level, that means application developers need to not only check but also embrace the change. And we should.

Not only does this new presentation mode give users something they have long wanted and asked for, but it also has an impact on other areas of the devices. For example, with true black _off_ pixels in the displays thanks to [OLED technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED) it helps to extend battery life, even if just by a little bit.

If you did not go crazy with your application UI design and custom colors then you may be in for a surprise and discover that you are good to go, or maybe at least mostly on the way there.

Apple designers worked hard on building a great set of color systems in both modes that not only feel natural but pleasing to the eye at varying brightness levels and view environments.

If you are not sure how to start working with the new dark/light mode support then I recommend checking out the [WWDC 2019 videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2019/) and supporting Apple [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface/).
