I know, you have heard so many including me say it before “if only we had Xcode on iPad”.

Now that we have the chip problem out of the way with the M1, the remaining question for me was “how would it look on that screen”.

Luna Display to the rescue to help me answer that question, and a bonus surprise was that I could use the magic cover with keyboard and touchpad just fine to navigate around Xcode and type in all the editors.

Essentially the Luna Display lets me use my MacMini headless if I want over my iPad.

So Apple, it’s your turn.
