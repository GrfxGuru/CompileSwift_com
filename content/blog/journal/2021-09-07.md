title: Are we there yet beta?

Now that we are close to the release time frame and we are getting weekly beta releases (for the most part), I’m wondering if Apple will greet me back from a short vacation away from the keyboard with release candidates?

macOS still feels good but the latest iPadOS beta has been a little more touch and go than the previous releases for me, mostly UI glitches and random Safari drops the Home Screen. Hopefully those are all minor and being worked out.

Bring on the Fall, I’m ready to wipe the Mac and start over with 12.
