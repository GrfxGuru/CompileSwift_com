---

It has been a busy evening for me catching up on the first day announcements and making a ton of notes ready to work on new content for CompileSwift.com

So far my list includes

- All the new OS’ including [macOS 11](https://developer.apple.com/macos/), yes I said *11*.
- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) overview and all the new things to make development faster and easier.
- I seem to recall something about a two year transition plan to Apple’s own silicon, away from Intel chips. :)
- Widgets on the [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) and [iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/ipados/) home screen … I know right!
- Shareable Apple Watch faces.
- A massive new Safari release.


And that is just for starters. Rest assured I won’t rush it out to beat the crowd for clicks like a lot of those other sites, I’m taking my time and preparing [Podcast episodes](https://compileswift.com/podcast) and articles.

If the download and run goes well, I hope to even get some Xcode 12 videos out there in-between beta crashes. Sorry Apple, I couldn’t resist a poke, I know they are betas.
