This weekend I uploaded the next video in the series where I start building out the master list view.

The video covers creating the view using SwiftUI, in particular the list and item views. Before SwiftUI we would call these custom table cells.

This was actually a harder video to make than I anticipated since the goal of the series was to 'do it live' and that includes showing the thought process as I figure out the views. I did not want to pre-problem solve and make everything flawless as I want views to understand the process as much as the code.

I feel it is important for developers of all levels, especially those new to development to understand that we all make silly mistakes as we go, regardless of experience.
