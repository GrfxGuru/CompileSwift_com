It is an exciting day!

We got Xcode 12.2 release candidate along with macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 Release Candidate. The later can now be used to submit apps to the App Store which is always a good sign.

Whilst not a complete surprise that these have dropped before the next Apple event, it does suggest that the new Apple silicon based Macâ€™s will be released very soon.

We also got iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS 14.2 final releases.
