A note for podcast subscribers and listeners.

I am in the process of moving the podcast hosting from anchor.fm to transistor.fm. This should be seamless for anyone subscribed via their players. Indeed, it may have already happened and you did not even notice.

You will notice that the Web pages for the podcast episodes is different, part of the reason for the move is to offer a much-improved experience for those that like to play it on the Web and to make the archived episodes (77 as of this post) easier to browse and search.

I will need to update the player across the posts on CompileSwift.com and will try to get those done as quickly as I can.

If you want to visit the Podcast listing directly you can find it at [https://compileswift.transistor.fm](https://compileswift.transistor.fm). I recommend always finding the episodes directly on this site at [https://compileswift.com/podcast](https://compileswift.com/podcast).

Thanks for your patience during this transition.
Peter.
