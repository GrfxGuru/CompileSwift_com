description: Recorded live stream of my work on a macOS app I built to help me write blog posts faster. This session is refactoring the template keys to a JSON file.

In this session I had one goal, refactor the blog post template keys out of the application code and into a JSON file for easier management going forward.

This is just the first phase, the next will be to have it editable within the application and remove it completely from the application bundle. Probably with some default fall back configuration in case things go wrong in the JSON file out side of the application bundle.

You can enjoy the sad moment when I try to add items to an Array to then remember that I made it a Dictionary! Hey it's live coding, we all get things wrong and forget stuff.
