description: I have been playing around with storing some code that I use repeatedly in a Swift Package. So time to ask a question of you.

As I work to move some of my code that I use across projects in to a Swift Package, it struck me that it was time for a quick poll in this new year to see what the trend is from you, the Swift community.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which do you plan to use the most this year?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SwiftLang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SwiftLang</a></p>&mdash; CompileSwift (@CompileSwift) <a href="https://twitter.com/CompileSwift/status/1350897591123402754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Thanks, the results I think are going to be interesting.
