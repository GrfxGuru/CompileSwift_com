description: There was a lot this year from WWDC, but these are the videos that I feel are a must watch for Swift developers.

As Swift developers we have a tough time keeping up with all the changes and progression of the Swift language and tools. WWDC20 this year was another block buster conference for new things that we should pay attention to.

I have compiled a list of videos from WWDC20 that I feel are important for developers to watch at least once. These range from changes to the language to tools and frameworks that will help us make better apps.

The list is in no particular order, however I do recommend watching the State of the Union first.
