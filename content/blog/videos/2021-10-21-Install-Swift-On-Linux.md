You would think that Swift is a language only available on Apple devices, but you would be wrong.

You can use Swift on other operating systems for a variety of uses. This video will walk you through each step for installing the Swift toolchain on Linux, enabling you to create and run Swift-based applications on a Linux machine.

I should note that this is Swift. The UI layers are not available on Linux. Those are specific to Apple devices.

Donâ€™t get disheartened, though. There are plenty of uses for Swift on other platforms. For example, Swift is also becoming a popular server-side language for powering Web applications. (Tip, this will be the next video in the series).
