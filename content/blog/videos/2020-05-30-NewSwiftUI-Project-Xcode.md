Creating a new project in Xcode is super easy yes, but it essentially dumps all the files in one group and makes a mess in the project view, in my opinion.

So when I create a new project, I always do some clean up right away, even before I make the repository and my first commit.

In this short video I’m going to share that clean up with you as my suggested way to make a fresh start.

I’d love to know how you create a new project and if there is anything you do right away, why not reach out to me on [Twitter: @CompileSwift](https://twitter.com/compileswift) and let me know.
