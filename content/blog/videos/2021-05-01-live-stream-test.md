You probably missed the live stream test because I did not announce it just in case it all imploded horribly. 

But hey, it was not all that bad. So here’s the replay for the next 14 days (I think that’s twitch.tv retention time).

I’ll be announcing them in the future so keep an eye on [twitter](https://twitter.com/compileswift)

I would love it if you dropped by and watched, why not drop in the chat at the same time.
