description: Adding items to a Mac app menu is straight forward, but there are a couple of gotchas to watch out for.

Learn how to add extra items to a Mac application in Xcode, there are a couple of things to watch out for, I encounter a couple of weird bugs in Xcode 11 and 12 and will show I solve the problem.

The question I get the most is how to hook the menu item to some Swift code to have it do something, the easiest way is via the AppDelegate and I will show you that as well.

This video uses storyboards to achieve the end result, you can also do this with code.

I am planning to make a SwiftUI version for those that are curious and have plans to move over to the new layout coolness that is SwiftUI.
