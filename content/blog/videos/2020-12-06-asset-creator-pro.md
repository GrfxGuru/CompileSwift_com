Making sure you have all the right sizes for all the different resolutions is getting to be a pain with so many device and store requirements these days.

So I set out on a mission to find a better way to help me create them, that is when I found Asset Catalog Creator Pro on the [SetApp service](https://go.setapp.com/invite/f8627428-ba2a-4c15-8976-3b78f218ce2b).

This video shows how I can use one image file to create all the icons need and export them as a catalog ready to be dropped in Xcode and compile.
