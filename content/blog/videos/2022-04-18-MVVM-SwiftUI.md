Thanks to a viewer of the YouTube channel for this one.

How do you use MVVM (Model View ViewModel) with SwiftUI. This is a lot easier than you may think, as a bonus a quick introduction in the video for those that might not be familiar with this concept. Itâ€™s all the rage at the moment, so watch the video and become one of the cool kids.

Love to hear your thoughts on it, leave a comment on the video.
