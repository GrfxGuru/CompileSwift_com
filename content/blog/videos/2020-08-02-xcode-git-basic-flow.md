Xcode has great support for Git, in this video, I show you how to make commits, change and create branches, merge branches, and push to remote repositories.

Understanding the basic usage of Git in Xcode not only saves you round trips to other applications or the terminal but means you are more likely to make small commits more often, which is exactly what you should be doing.

If you need to know how to connect a remote GitHub repository to your Xcode project, I have just the video for you [right here https://youtu.be/v25er68nnk8](https://youtu.be/v25er68nnk8).
