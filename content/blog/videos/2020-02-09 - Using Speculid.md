In this video I show you how to use the free [Speculid](https://speculid.com) tool to automate the generation of assets and add them to Xcode.

Speculid is at it's core a CLI (Command Line Interface) application that you can script to run as needed and configured to create exactly what you need, beit one image or icon to an entire library.

Using the steps in this video you can have the assets generate everytime you run a build (optional) to ensure they are always update from the source file(s).

With just one SVG file I generate all the icon sizes I need for an iOS application and apply them in the Asset catalog automatically.

You can [jump straight to Speculid](https://speculid.com) here to read the documentation and install.
