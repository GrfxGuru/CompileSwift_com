In this short video I will cover the basic set up for listening and sending a notification event using Swift. This example shows a button sending an event on click and a label listening for that event and updating the displayed text.

This is a great way to get away from hard coding references to the various parts of your application, why might you want to do that? Well, for starters, you no longer have to maintain that linkage and ensure it is updated as needed over time.

I bet if you look at your code bases you will see areas that you can take advantage of notification center.
