This week the live stream was a lot of fun as always. Before starting the stream I had spent about an hour playing with [Figma](https://figma.com), a design and prototyping tool.

The goal was to see how well it stood up against my goto tool which is Sketch. I am not planning to replace sketch, but I always believe in exploring different options to keep on top of the tools out there.

I’m not going to spoil the outcome here in the notes, I’ll let the stream do that for me.

If you are interested in prototyping and view designs then I think this will be of interest to you as it allows for rapid idea progression, changes, and testing on a device without having to write any code.

Great for giving clients a quick idea to sign off on before starting the real work.
